# Generative AI - RAG Demo
Demo Question Answering System using RAG

This application is designed to provide answers to user questions using both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a direct model response (No RAG). It was built this way to compare the effectiveness of answers with and without the use of RAG. **This code was created only for demo and training purposes and not for production usage!**
